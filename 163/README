To play 163, run 163.jar. To play 24 (easier version), run 24.jar.

OBJECTIVE:
163: Make 163 from 6 cards (1...13) using only 4 basic arithmetic operations.
24: Make 24 from 4 cards

HOW TO PLAY:
You have a number of cards; you want to combine the cards into one card, whose value is your target (either 24 or 163). You can combine two cards into one card by adding, multiplying, subtracting, or dividing their numerical values. 

The QUEUE is a list of cards which you can control; the purpose of the queue is to make consecutive combine-operations more efficient. The first two cards in the queue are the cards that you can merge.

CONTROLS:
QUEUE (click a card OR [for 163 only] type one of 1,2,3,q,w,e) 
	to put/remove card from queue
SUM (+) to add first two cards in queue
PRODUCT (x) to multiply
DIFFERENCE (-) to subtract
QUOTIENT (/) to divide

SHOVE (>) to swap queue positions of first two cards in queue
TELEPORT (>>) to remove the first card from queue and put it at the end.
TRAMPOLINE (#) to remove first card from queue
BIG TRAMPOLINE (##) to remove all cards from queue
EXPLOSION (*) to split first card in queue (turn it into two cards)
BIG EXPLOSION (**) to split all cards completely
JUGGLE (oo) to swap positions of first two cards in queue
BIG JUGGLE (ooo) to randomize cards

WIN (=) to draw a new set of 6 cards
HALP (?) to get a hint

NOTE: 
For dvorak/programmer-dvorak users, the 123qwe hotkeys are in the same position as they are in qwerty; e.g. just type 123',. instead. 
This is also why it's not qweasd.
